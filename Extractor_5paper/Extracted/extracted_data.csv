1-s2.0-S0022510X21003166-main.pdf,0.9,Wearing-off symptoms during standard and extended natalizumab dosing intervals: Experiences from the COVID-19 pandemic,Our observations support the need to study the effect of EID on wearing-off symptoms in randomized controlled trials.,Observational study,Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients over 18 years old receiving natalizumab,Extended interval dosing (EID) of natalizumab (from 4 to 6 weeks),"Standard interval dosing (SID, 4 weeks) vs Extended interval dosing (EID, 6 weeks)",Wearing-off symptoms (prevalence and intensity),"New or increased wearing-off symptoms during EID were reported by 50% of patients. Symptom increase was more frequent in patients with pre-existing wearing-off symptoms during standard dosing compared to patients without such pre-existing symptoms [p = 0.0005]. None had decreased symptoms. Median natalizumab receptor occupancy (RO) at standard dosing was lower in 9 of 11 leukocyte subtypes in patients who later reported symptom increase during EID compared to patients with unchanged symptoms during EID, but the difference was not statistically significant."

Patients still symptomatic at reinfusion had a mean time to full recovery of 10±12 days. Overall cohort showed mean intervals from symptoms to reinfusion (19±9 days), symptom onset to full recovery (13±9 days), and positive to negative swab (32±15 days) consistent with general population outcomes."
1-s2.0-S1878747924000370-main.pdf,0.9,Commentary Extended interval dosing of natalizumab: More evidence in support,"The main findings support extending natalizumab dosing interval without compromising benefits and potentially reducing PML risk. EID offers cost and convenience benefits but lacks first-line study data and needs more research on active disease patients. Further studies, including those on drug concentrations, are needed. Continued monitoring of registries is essential for PML risk assessment.",Commentary,"Adults with multiple sclerosis (MS), predominantly female, with average disease duration of 8.5 years, many with prior disease-modifying therapy",Extended interval dosing of natalizumab (EID),Standard interval dosing (SID) vs. Extended interval dosing (EID),"Evidence of disease activity (EDA), defined as clinical relapses, MRI activity, or disability worsening per the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)","No differences in primary outcomes between SID and EID (5–7 weeks); trend toward higher clinical relapse hazard with EID (HR 1.74, 95% CI 0.99–3.02, p=0.054); BMI interaction with treatment regimen affecting EDA; no differences in EDA when using inverse probability treatment weighted models."
10.1007@s00415-014-7574-6.pdf,0.9,Intense immunosuppression for the treatment of an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome-like exacerbation after natalizumab withdrawal: a case report,"In the meantime, IRIS can be a serious manifestation related to NTZ treatment interruption and the administration of intense immunosuppression, once PML is ruled out, a therapeutic option for such rapidly worsening condition. The information provided may be useful because controlled trials for this rare complication are unlikely.",Case report,43-year-old woman with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (MS),Intense immunosuppression (1 g of IV cyclophosphamide followed by a cycle of rituximab),"Standard therapy (IVMP, plasma exchange) vs intense immunosuppression","Clinical and radiological improvement (EDSS improved from 9.0 to 3.0, lesions decreased)","Patient's condition improved clinically (EDSS 5.0) and radiologically (lesions reduced), eventually EDSS 3.0 after treatment."

Mean age 35.6±9.7 years, 71.6% female. Relapse rate pre-NTZ: 3.1±1.51, post-NTZ: 0.20±0.57 (p=0.001). EDSS pre-NTZ: 4.5±1.94, post-NTZ: 3.8±2.7 (p=0.013). No PML cases identified at last follow-up (38.3±22.78 months)."
