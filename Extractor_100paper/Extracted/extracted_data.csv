Median natalizumab RO at SID was lower in 9 of 11 leukocyte subtypes in patients who later reported symptom increase during EID compared to patients with unchanged symptoms during EID, but the difference was not statistically significant."

Insight_into_motor_fatigue_mechanisms_in_natalizum.pdf,1.0,Insight into motor fatigue mechanisms in natalizumab treated multiple sclerosis patients with wearing off,"Our findings suggest that the mechanisms of motor fatigue during wearing-off are similar to those underlying MS-related motor fatigue. Specifically, the wearing-off-related fatigue in MS is caused by an impaired M1 output and altered task-induced modulation of M1 effective connectivity within the SMN. Given the improvement of these abnormalities following natalizumab infusion, motor fatigue in MS may reflect reversible, inflammation-derived changes in neural transmission within the SMN. Our results suggest that natalizumab’s ability to reduce motor fatigue is likely due to its influence on cortical processes involved in the underlying mechanisms of motor fatigue. Although our findings apply primarily to MS patients receiving natalizumab, we believe they provide valuable insights into the broader mechanisms of MS-related fatigue. Further research is essential to generalize our findings, particularly in patients under different treatments that exhibit a wearing-off effect33.

Today, neurologists have to make complex treatment decisions together with their patients, sometimes on the basis of very limited clinical data and evidence. It becomes even more complex, since risk perceptions between patients and treating physician can differ dramatically, as shown for the PML risk perception in the context of natalizumab. Thus, optimal assessment of risks and benefits remain challenging.

Importantly, continuing natalizumab into the later stages of pregnancy demonstrated a protective effect, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for these women.

This trend is likely attributable to an immunological shift, marked by a Th2-dominant response, reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increased estrogen and progesterone levels. Notably, patients who had been treated with natalizumab or fingolimod exhibited higher relapse rates compared to those who had used other DMTs. This may reflect a potential selection bias, as these therapies are often prescribed for patients with more severe diseases, who may inherently present with higher relapse rates regardless of treatment discontinuation. Natalizumab continuation into the second trimester is associated with safety and a reduction in relapse risk, whereas fingolimod, due to its teratogenic risk, must be discontinued before conception.

Recent data have demonstrated sustained efficacy on long-term use with no new safety concerns. Treatment is limited by the risk of PML. Although risk stratification allows estimation of a low, intermediate, or high PML risk, current strategies do not allow risk prediction in the individual patient.

Discontinuation of natalizumab may lead to recurrence of disease activity. Pre-natalizumab activity levels as well as duration of the washout period may influence the postnatalizumab relapse risk.
