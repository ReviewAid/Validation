Balduzzi et al. - 2019 - How to perform a meta-analysis with R a practical tutorial.pdf,How to perform a meta-analysis with R: a practical tutorial,Sara Balduzzi,2019,0.95,"The paper focuses on a meta-analysis tutorial using R for evaluating haloperidol in schizophrenia treatment, which does not involve the specified interventions (Natalizumab, SID, EID) or outcome (MS). The population is not relevant as the study uses a dataset from a schizophrenia review, and the interventions/exclusion criteria for MS-specific drugs are not met."

Although the intervention (Natalizumab) and outcomes (MS) are relevant, the population is a child, so the paper is excluded."
