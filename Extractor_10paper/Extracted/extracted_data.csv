Symptom increase was more frequent among patients with pre-existing wearing-off symptoms during standard dosing compared to patients without such pre-existing symptoms [p = 0.0005]. None had decreased symptoms. Median natalizumab RO at SID was lower in 9 of 11 leukocyte subtypes in patients who later reported symptom increase during EID compared to patients with unchanged symptoms during EID, but the difference was not statistically significant."

Bernardes et al. - 2024 - Natalizumab extended interval dosing what about wearing-off effect.pdf,0.9,Natalizumab extended interval dosing: what about wearing-off effect?,"WO affects a significant proportion of MS patients under natalizumab. Despite clinical effectiveness maintenance, its prevalence, severity, and duration increase on EID, and therefore, we recommend that this posology should be individualized. Further investigation to elucidate the cause of WO and possible association with disease activity, namely on EID, is needed to ultimately guide dosing decisions.",Observational retrospective study,"Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) receiving natalizumab therapy (clinically stable patients on natalizumab for more than one year, switched to extended interval dosing)",Extended interval dosing (EID) with every six weeks infusions,Standard interval dosing (SID) vs. Extended interval dosing (EID),"Wearing-off (WO) effect (prevalence, severity, duration) and annual relapse rate (ARR)","Seventy-six patients were included. No significant differences were found in the annual relapse rate after the switch to EID (p = 0.083). However, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients complaining of WO from 38.2% to 56.6% (p = 0.001). Moreover, patients with WO on SID, referred a significant increase in severity (p = 0.019) and duration of WO symptoms (p = 0.029), due to an anticipation of the symptoms relative to the day of natalizumab infusion (p = 0.019), when switching to EID."

We found that EID did not compromise the treatment effect as measured by relapse rate and no significant breakthrough disease activity was observed. EID is an optional regimen for maintenance natalizumab therapy, but prospective studies are warranted to determine its efficacy.",Retrospective review (chart review),Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with natalizumab at two MS centers,Extended interval dosing (EID) of natalizumab (administered every 6 or 8 weeks instead of every 4 weeks),Monthly dosing (standard every 4 weeks) of natalizumab vs extended interval dosing (EID),"Clinical relapse rate and MRI activity (number of new T2, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery or contrast enhancing lesions)","A total of 361 patients received natalizumab for 22 ± 13 months... Over the study period, there was no significant difference between the relapse rate in the monthly dosing (13%) and the EID (13%) groups...

Brandstadter et al. - 2017 - The use of natalizumab for multiple sclerosis.pdf,1.0,The use of natalizumab for multiple sclerosis,"Natalizumab remains an important part of the treatment arsenal for patients with RRMS. It has proven to be highly efficacious in the reduction of clinical relapses and prevention of new MRI activity. Though generally well-tolerated, natalizumab does carry a risk for the life-threatening condition PML. Risk mitigation awareness and development of a formal monitoring program have encouraged careful prescribing of natalizumab, though the risk of PML has not been fully eliminated. Future work continues into the development of new biomarkers that may better predict an individual’s risk of PML and further improve upon natalizumab’s safety.",Review,Multiple sclerosis patients (including relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive subtypes),Natalizumab,"Placebo, interferon beta-1a, and other treatments","Clinical relapse rate, MRI lesion activity, disability progression","Natalizumab demonstrated high efficacy in Phase III trials by reducing the annualized relapse rate, preventing multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion accumulation on magnetic resonance imaging, and decreasing the probability of sustained progression of disability."
