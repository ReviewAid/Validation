1-s2.0-S1878747924000370-main.pdf,0.9,Commentary Extended interval dosing of natalizumab: More evidence in support,"The main findings of the study by Ruggieri et al. are in line with previous observational studies demonstrating similar benefits with EID versus SID at a dosing interval of 6 weeks. This supports the notion of being able to extend the natalizumab dosing interval without compromising expected benefits, and potentially reducing harm of PML. Reductions in infusion frequency also have the benefits of decreasing cost and increasing patient convenience. Nevertheless, EID natalizumab has not been studied as a first line approach, and most participants in the current study were on previous treatments. Additional data are needed in patients with more recently diagnosed, and likely more active, disease. Although the exploratory BMI analysis is a valuable addition to the literature, further studies are needed, ideally including parallel information on natalizumab concentrations and target receptor saturation. An ongoing prospective Dutch study is poised to provide further high-quality evidence re...",Commentary,"Adults with multiple sclerosis (mostly female, mean disease duration ~8.5 years, many with prior disease-modifying therapy)",Extended interval dosing of natalizumab,Standard interval dosing (SID) vs. Extended interval dosing (EID),"Evidence of disease activity (EDA), defined as clinical relapses, MRI activity, or disability worsening per the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)","Primary analysis showed no differences between SID and EID (5–7 weeks) for specified outcomes.

These results suggest that SC administration of 300 mg natalizumab Q4W could be an alternative option for patients with RRMS.","Exploratory, dose- and frequency-blinded, prospective, randomized, dose-ranging phase 2 study",Clinically stable relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients previously treated with 300 mg natalizumab intravenously for ≥12 months,"Natalizumab administered via various regimens (including 300 mg intravenous or subcutaneous every 4 weeks, 300 mg intravenous or subcutaneous every 12 weeks, 150 mg intravenous or subcutaneous every 12 weeks)","Different natalizumab dosing regimens (e.g., 300 mg intravenous vs subcutaneous every 4 weeks, 300 mg every 12 weeks vs 4 weeks, etc.)",Mean cumulative number of combined unique active MRI lesions at week 60; annualized relapse rate (ARR) at week 60; proportion of patients with protocol-defined relapse; proportion of patients with 12-week confirmed disability worsening; change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from baseline through week 60,"290 patients enrolled; Q12W dosing arms closed early due to increased disease activity; 300 mg IV and SC Q4W arms showed comparable efficacy (MRI lesions, relapse rates), PK/PD, and safety; SC Q4W was comparable to IV Q4W in efficacy, PK/PD, and safety."

Eighty-four percent extended the interval from a 4-week interval to a 5-7-week interval. No patient developed gadolinium enhancing lesions (95% CI 0 – 7.4%) during follow-up. No new/enlarging T2 lesions (95% CI 0 – 7.4%) or relapses (95% CI 0 – 7.4%) were reported during follow-up and in the extension phase.

Of these, 44 patients were referred to the expert panel because of clinical findings of possible PML, abnormalities on MRI, or a high plasma viral load of JC virus. No patient had detectable JC virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid. PML was ruled out in 43 of the 44 patients, but it could not be ruled out in one patient who had multiple sclerosis and progression of neurologic disease because data on cerebrospinal fluid testing and follow-up MRI were not available. Only the three previously reported cases of PML were confirmed (1.0 per 1000 treated patients; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 2.8 per 1000)."
