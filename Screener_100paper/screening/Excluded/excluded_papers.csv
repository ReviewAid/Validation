1-s2.0-S2211034819309642-main11.pdf,Long-term real-world evidence for sustained clinical benefits of fingolimod following switch from natalizumab,Tjalf Ziemssena,2020,0.95,"The paper evaluates fingolimod as the intervention, but the PICO criteria exclude fingolimod from the intervention inclusion list. Therefore, it fails the intervention criterion."
004_Pregnancy-related_relapse_in_natalizumab_fingo.pdf,"004 PREGNANCY-RELATED RELAPSE IN NATALIZUMAB, FINGOLIMOD AND DIMETHYL FUMARATE-TREATED WOMEN WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",Wei Z Yeh,2021,0.95,"The paper includes Fingolimod as an intervention, which is explicitly excluded per the PICO criteria. While the population (adults) and outcomes (MS) align, the intervention criterion is violated."
3138_Effectiveness_of_cladribine_compared_to_fingo.pdf,Not Found,Not Found,Not Found,0.95,"The paper discusses Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) and intraarterial vasodilation, which does not address the specified population (adults), intervention (Natalizumab, SID, EID), or outcome (MS). No relevant information is present."
A_comparison_of_natalizumab_and_ocrelizumab_on_dis.pdf,A comparison of natalizumab and ocrelizumab on disease progression in multiple sclerosis,Pietro Iaffaldano,2024,0.95,"The paper compares natalizumab (included intervention) and ocrelizumab (excluded intervention), thus failing the intervention criterion."
Balduzzi et al. - 2019 - How to perform a meta-analysis with R a practical tutorial.pdf,How to perform a meta-analysis with R: a practical tutorial,Sara Balduzzi,2019,0.95,"The paper is a meta-analysis tutorial using haloperidol in schizophrenia as an example. The intervention (haloperidol) is not among the specified interventions (Natalizumab, SID, EID), and the outcomes focus on clinical improvement in schizophrenia, not Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Thus, it does not meet the inclusion criteria."
martinelli2016.pdf,Recurrent disease-activity rebound in a patient with multiple sclerosis after natalizumab discontinuations for pregnancy planning,Martinelli,2013,0.95,"The paper describes a case of a 16-year-old (child) with multiple sclerosis, which violates the population inclusion criterion (adults only). Although the intervention (natalizumab) is included, the population is a child, so the paper is excluded."
Natalizumab.pdf,Disease Progression in Pregnant Women with Relapsing–Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Treated with Fingolimod or Natalizumab Prior to Conception: A Systematic Review,Alice Campos Meneses,2025,0.95,"The paper includes Fingolimod as an intervention, which is explicitly excluded in the intervention criteria. Although Natalizumab is included, the presence of an excluded intervention (Fingolimod) leads to exclusion."
Pediatric-onset_Multiple_Sclerosis_treatment_a_mul.pdf,Pediatric-onset Multiple Sclerosis treatment: a multicentre observational study comparing natalizumab with fingolimod,Antonio Carotenuto,2024,0.95,"The paper focuses on Pediatric-onset Multiple Sclerosis (children), which is explicitly excluded per the population criteria. Although it includes natalizumab (an intervention in inclusion), the primary failure is the population being children rather than adults."
"Walton et al. - 2020 - Rising prevalence of multiple sclerosis worldwide Insights from the Atlas of MS, third edition.pdf","Rising prevalence of multiple sclerosis worldwide: Insights from the Atlas of MS, third edition",Clare Walton,2020,0.95,"The paper focuses on the epidemiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) including global prevalence, incidence, and regional trends, but does not address the specified interventions (Natalizumab, SID, EID) or their comparison. It includes data on adults and children but lacks content related to the interventions in the PICO criteria."
