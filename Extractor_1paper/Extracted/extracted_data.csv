1-s2.0-S0022510X21003166-main.pdf,0.9,Wearing-off symptoms during standard and extended natalizumab dosing intervals: Experiences from the COVID-19 pandemic,Our observations support the need to study the effect of EID on wearing-off symptoms in randomized controlled trials.,Observational study,RRMS patients over 18 years of age receiving natalizumab,Extended interval dosing (EID) from 4 to 6 weeks,Standard interval dosing (SID) vs extended interval dosing (EID),Wearing-off symptoms,"New or increased wearing-off symptoms during EID were reported by 50%. Symptom increase was more frequent among patients with pre-existing wearing-off symptoms during standard dosing compared to patients without such pre-existing symptoms [p = 0.0005]. None had decreased symptoms. Median natalizumab RO at SID was lower in 9 of 11 leukocyte subtypes in patients who later reported symptom increase during EID compared to patients with unchanged symptoms during EID, but the difference was not statistically significant."
