These results come from a large, retrospective multicenter study that can have a very useful implication in clinical practice. According to our results, continuing natalizumab in an EID setting seems an efficacious therapeutic strategy in patients with highly active MS who decide to continue natalizumab 24 doses. The absence of evidence of a reduced efficacy of the EID strategy could be taken into account in planning further studies aimed at impacting the decision process about the therapeutic management of JCV-positive patients after 24 doses of natalizumab.

Magro et al. - 2023 - Natalizumab wearing-off symptoms effect of extend interval dosing during Sars-CoV-2 pandemic.pdf,0.9,Natalizumab wearing‑off symptoms: effect of extend interval dosing during Sars‑CoV‑2 pandemic,"Adopting an extended interval dosing does not result in significantly different occurrence of WoS between the ExID and the StID populations, in our cohort of patients. Interestingly, there is a strong correlation between WoS and a higher EDSS and FSS. Safety and efficacy of Natalizumab with ExID are relatively preserved in our study.",Observational study,Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with Natalizumab,Extended interval dosing (ExID) of Natalizumab (administered every 5-6 weeks),"Standard interval dosing (StID, 4-weekly) versus extended interval dosing (ExID, 5-6-weekly)",Wearing-off symptoms (WoS),"Among the 86 patients, 32 (37.2%) reported WoS; most common symptom was fatigue (93.7%); mean EDSS was higher in the WoS group (3.8 vs 3.1, p < 0.05); sphincterial function EDSS item differed significantly (1.4 vs 0.6, p < 0.001); WoS correlated with FSS (p < 0.001); safety and efficacy of Natalizumab with ExID were relatively preserved."
